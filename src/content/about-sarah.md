### Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo is an artist, programmer, and erstwhile data designer. **[Her work](/works) focuses on using the digital in a manner that can transcend its squalid and militaristic roots and reach out towards the sublime.** She has created data-obscured art sites, new computer languages, and hybrid nostalgia machines. 

### **Her [current focus](/about-art) is livecoded performances and abstract digital installations.** For both, she makes use of image processing tools new and old, from the Jones frame buffer to a time-based SVG framework she developed herself.
