## [Livecode](https://toplap.org/) is an international movement organized around algoraves. [Algoraves](https://algorave.com/) are experimental multimedia nights where music and visuals are produced though coding live. **Usually performers project the code they use to generate sound and [visuals](/sketches) as they play.**

## Codie performs often with [Livecode.nyc](http://livecode.nyc/).
