### **Computer history is inherently violent.** Computers were developed as tools of war and surveillance, and only entered the private sphere when corporate interests began to comprehend the power they afforded.  **The personal computer revolution was nothing more than an idealistic blip; as individual machines began connecting to a vast communications network, established players in the world economy managed to once more affirm computing’s autocratic tendencies.**

### **My practice seeks to re-center the feverish world of increasingly interconnected devices into a personal, transcendent experience with light and motion.** Computers should be used as machines of hope, expanding and stimulating the viewer’s experience of light, color, and time.

### **[In my most recent work](/works), I engage the digital medium via a focus on abstraction, movement, and transitions.** Starting with base images generated by my own custom animation framework and inspired by live-coded performance sets, I further manipulate footage with image processing tools spanning the history of visual computing. **Equipment such as the Jones frame buffer, the Fairlight CVI, and modern video editors all exert an influence on the final product.** The results are best experienced immersively, in a space that allows relaxation and mindful contemplation.

### **Computer art is not often associated with live performance.** My work is improvisational and imperfect—characteristics that stem from from livecoding. **My tools generate work that explores the materiality of the digital: it is not smooth and continuous, but crunchy and unsteady.** My style carries an implicit critique of the positivist, perfectionist assumptions that lurk in code. **Combining computer animation capabilities, frame-driven rhythms, and oversized patterns drawn from analog printing techniques, I draw parallels from previous movements with similar interests in the transcendent and the degraded: suprematism, pop art, and color field paintings.**
